## Necessities
*Ensure that participants are capable of communicating properly(link) with their audience 
*In the event of multiple presenters, ensure coherence in style and content 

## Priorities

### A) Overall Coherence
There are a multitude of factors that must be internalized to calibrate attitudes, content, and presentation style

  * Guiding Questions 
      - General
        * "What are the main themes addressed?"
        * "What is the primary conclusion"
        * "What is the sentiment of the conclusion?
        * "What are the potential pitfalls of the conclusions and sentiments?"
        
      - Know you audience
        * "What is the background of the audience"
        * "What is the technical depth of the audience?"
        * "What are their expectations?"
        * "How will they react to the conclusions and sentiment?"
        * "How are they expected to respond professionally to the information presented?"  
        
### B) Structural Coherence
Proper argumentation and easily digestible flow of ideas are both essential to giving an effective presentation 

  * Does the presentation include transition slides and key idea (introductory, conclusion) slides?
  * Do the ideas unfold according to expected semantic structures?
  Example: (Proposition P) -> ( Supporting Argument A (Details) ) ( Supporting Argument B (Details) ) = (Meaningful Connection that supports or elucidates Proposition P)
