5. Criteria

## 1. Necessities
* Ensure that participants are capable of communicating properly(link) with their audience 
* In the event of multiple presenters, ensure coherence in style and content 

## 2. Priorities

Identify practices that:
1) lead to false understanding
2) lead to reduced understanding
3) increase cognitive load on audience
4) are potentially annoying and irritating 

### ESL Skills

Ensure that presenter can: 
1) use basic verb tenses
2) describe and contextualize data and graphs
3) understands and can properly use domain-specific terminology 
For further details, See (link) Criteria for Baseline Fluency

### Soft Skills

Audience engagement determines audience comprehension

4 factors that determine audience engagement:
1. flow of the presenter
2. confidence of the presenter
3. personability of the presenter
4. personability of the presentation 

Flow of the presenter: 

Confidence of the presenter:

Personability of the presenter:
* greeting
* voice (rhythm, volume, pitch)
* body language (active and resting, hands, hips, leg distance, head position
* posture 
* eye Contact
* dress

Personability of the presentation:
* storytelling devices
* humane contextualization
* visual aids
* information calibrated to technical depth and expectations of audience

### Presentation Coherence

#### A) Overall Coherence
There are a multitude of factors that must be internalized to calibrate attitudes, content, and presentation style

  * Guiding Questions 
      - General
        * "What are the main themes addressed?"
        * "What is the primary conclusion"
        * "What is the sentiment of the conclusion?
        * "What are the potential pitfalls of the conclusions and sentiments?"
        * "Where will the presentation be held (location) and what are it's features?"
        * "How many people will be present"
        
      - Know you audience
        * "What is the background of the audience
        * "What is the hiearchical configuration of the audience in relation to the presenter?"
        * "What is the technical depth of the audience?"
        * "What are their expectations?"
        * "How will they react to the conclusions and sentiment?"
        * "How are they expected to respond professionally to the information presented?"  
        
#### B) Structural Coherence
Rigorously structured argumentation and easily digestible flow of ideas are both essential to giving a good presentation

  * Does the presentation include transition slides and key idea (introductory, conclusion) slides?
  * Do the ideas unfold according to expected semantic structures?
  Example: (Proposition P) -> ( Supporting Argument A (Details) ) ( Supporting Argument B (Details) ) = (Meaningful Connection that supports or elucidates Proposition P)
  
  
#### C) Slide by Slide Analysis

#### D) Design Decisions
Critera:
Must follow UX best practices 
 (Information Hiearchy respected by elements in a slide)
Must follow visual design best practices
eg: relationship of elements communicated through space, spacing, color, contrast, size, and composition
Check resolution of Images


## Activities

*Identify and itemize inadequencies for each presenter
*Sort errors based on priority

##
-----

Ask for presentations in advance, revise at a distance; if there are considerable problems with coherence, set meeting. These presetnations must be sent and corrected in advance of orientation meeting, so that our specialists can get an idea of the linguistic, technical, and rhetorical fluency of the presenters.
